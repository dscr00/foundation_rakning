# foundation_ranking
For ranking foundation jobs. Based on order of jobs, specialty and hospital location.


This is based on the Wessex region. There may well be a few changes to make for different deaneries, the script is not very flexible.

Download your preference.csv from the oriel website (cannot be an .xlsx)

It will return a csv with a score assigned to each rotation. Sort these inside excel and you have you jobs ranking!

adjust the weightings according to your priorities. This can be done in the specialties spreadsheet and the dictionaries in the script I may change this in future to make it easier to assign scores.

Get in touch with any Qs!
